# Better PyMOL 3D Representations

The original proof used "sticks" representation which looks like cylinder capsules. Here are much better 3D visualization options:

## Recommended 3D Representations

### 1. Surface Representation (Best for 3D Effect)
```json
"3d": {
  "representation": "surface",
  "bg": "transparent"
}
```
**Advantages:**
- Shows molecular volume and shape
- Clear 3D depth and perspective  
- Excellent for visualizing molecular size and cavities
- Most obviously "3D" appearance

**Example**: `surface_3d_ibuprofen.png` (80KB) vs `surface_2d_ibuprofen.png` (7.3KB)

### 2. Cartoon+Licorice (Best for Proteins)
```json
"3d": {
  "representation": "cartoon+licorice", 
  "bg": "transparent"
}
```
**Advantages:**
- Shows both backbone structure (cartoon) and bonds (licorice/sticks)
- Good for larger molecules and proteins
- Balances detail with 3D structure

### 3. Enhanced Sticks (Improved Default)
To make the default sticks look better, we could add:
```python
cmd.set("stick_radius", 0.25)  # Thicker sticks
cmd.show("spheres", "mol")     # Add atomic spheres
cmd.set("sphere_scale", 0.3)   # Smaller spheres
```

## File Size Comparisons

| Representation | 2D Size | 3D Size | Ratio | Visual Impact |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Sticks         | 3.4KB   | 33KB    | 9.6x  | ⭐⭐ (cylinders) |
| Surface        | 7.3KB   | 80KB    | 11x   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (obvious 3D) |
| Cartoon+Licorice | TBD   | TBD     | TBD   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (good for proteins) |

## Recommendations

1. **Default to "surface"** for small molecules - most visually impressive 3D effect
2. **Use "cartoon+licorice"** for proteins and larger biomolecules  
3. **Enhance "sticks"** with spheres and thicker radii for better appearance
4. **Consider lighting and camera angles** for more dramatic 3D effects

## Implementation

Update the default representation in the API from "licorice" to "surface":

```python
representation = str(three_d.get("representation", "surface")).lower()  # Changed from "licorice"
```

This will make 3D renders much more obviously three-dimensional by default.

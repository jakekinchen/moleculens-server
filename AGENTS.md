I've completed the research and compiled my findings into a report in a markdown file. Here it is:

In summary, PyMOL’s strengths lie in its flexible representations, custom coloring options, measurement tools, and integrated ray-traced rendering, all of which can be orchestrated via its Python API for high-quality, automated molecular graphics. RCSB’s Mol\* suite complements this with web-based interactive viewing, sequence-feature mapping, ligand interaction analysis, and built-in high-resolution image export. Together, these tools enable robust on-demand visualization pipelines capable of fetching structures, annotating key interactions, aligning and comparing structures, and generating both static and interactive outputs.

If you need more details or further refinements, let me know.

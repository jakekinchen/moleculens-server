# Repository Organization Suggestions

This document proposes a few steps to improve the structure and clarity of the repository.

## 1. Add a Root README
Currently there is no README at the repository root. A short README describing the project, how to set it up, and the folder structure would help new contributors.

## 2. Create a Python Package Structure
Consider restructuring the `api` directory into a Python package. For example:

```
api/
    __init__.py
    main.py
    routers/
    agent_management/
    dependencies/
    static/
    tests/
```

Placing an `__init__.py` in `api/` and its subdirectories would allow importing modules using `api.<module>` paths and make it easier to distribute as a package.

## 3. Consolidate Test Assets
The `api/tests` directory contains various JSON files and test assets. Grouping related resources under a `fixtures` or `data` folder would keep the tests directory tidy.

## 4. Add a `.gitignore`
A `.gitignore` file would prevent generated files (e.g., `__pycache__`, temporary HTML output) from being committed.

## 5. Document the Deployment Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` references an SSH deployment script. Adding a short explanation in the root README about this deployment process would make it clearer for maintainers.
